                <p><I>A private school called the University of Perpetual Help System DALTA (UPHSD) Molino is situated in Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. The campus was built in 1995 in response to the Cavite area's increasing need for high-quality education. Students from Cavite and nearby provinces can access it because of its location close to residential and business areas.
                Through programs like medical missions, literacy drives, disaster relief operations, and other outreach projects that help the community, the university is dedicated to being involved in the community. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) have both accredited UPHSD Molino. Additionally, it has affiliations to associations for professionals such as the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU).</I></p>

Making friends and working together with my classmates and friends makes it even more fun learning and discovering new skills and explore the world of technologies.
                    My motivation and passion is how it will help me in the future, especially my career and how it will impact the world because I like my name to be known by many and leave my mark in this world when I'm gone. </I></p>
